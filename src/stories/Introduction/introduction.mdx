### A collection of customizable React components built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Storybook. The components have been designed to be lightweight and easy to integrate into React projects.

Explore the components and check out the live documentation using the sidebar.

## Requirements

Before installing and using this library, ensure that your project meets the following requirements:

- **React**: Version 19.0 or higher
- **Tailwind CSS**: Version 4.0 or higher

## Get Started

### Install @artstorefronts/ui

To install the library, use npm or yarn:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @artstorefronts/ui

# Using yarn
yarn add @artstorefronts/ui
```

### Import CSS

Add the following import to your project (usually in index.tsx or App.tsx):

```javascript
import '@artstorefronts/ui/dist/index.css';
```

### Install Tailwind CSS

You must also have Tailwind CSS installed in your project. If you don't have it yet, you can install it by following [these instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

## Usage

Once the library is installed, you can start using the components in your project. Here's an example of how to use a component:

```javascript
import { Button } from '@artstorefronts/ui';

const App = () => (
  <div className="container mx-auto">
    <Button variant="outline">Click Me</Button>
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

## Theme Customization

If you want to customize the theme colors, you can override the CSS variables in your project's CSS file:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: hsl(220 70% 50%);
  --color-secondary: hsl(160 60% 45%);
  /* Add more custom colors as needed */
}
```
